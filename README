According to https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/rigol-ds1000z-firmware-patch-plugins/
rigolif is this: "Very primitive program for working with an oscilloscope. It is given in the source texts. Allows you to read and write memory of the oscilloscope, call internal functions, load plug-ins."

I have quickly ported the application to GNU/Linux and hopefully other POSIX OSes as well.
